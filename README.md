## THE STORY

HIRA.VRT began as a university __bachelor thesis project__ with the aim of creating an interactive __web applications__ for learning __Japanese hiragana syllabary__. 

The main idea behind its creation was to make learning hiragana characters easier and accessible to a broader spectrum of users. The application itself was designed using Microsoft's __Blazor framework__ in order to improve the user experience. 

It is designed for people who want to learn the characters through a __quiz game__, where the user must correctly guess from a set of __randomly picked hiragana syllables__. This form of learning aims to enhance the __learning experience__ through replayability and the human desire for improvement.
