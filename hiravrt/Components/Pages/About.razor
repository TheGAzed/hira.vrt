        <h3>THE STORY</h3>
	</hgroup>

	<section id="first">
		HIRA.VRT began as a university bachelor thesis with the aim of creating an interactive web applications for learning Japanese hiragana syllabary. The main idea behind its creation was to make learning hiragana characters easier and accessible to a broader spectrum of users. The application itself was designed using Microsoft's Blazor framework in order to improve the user experience. It is designed for people who want to learn the characters through a quiz game, where the user must correctly guess from a set of randomly picked hiragana syllables. This form of learning aims to enhance the learning experience through replayability and the human desire for improvement.

		Currently, HIRA.VRT offers only one mode of learning in the form of an "Either-or" choice between two hiragana characters. The aim of this game mode is to select the correct answer based on the Latin equivalent among the given choices.
